CineMag was founded in 1979 in North Hollywood, California. Among its early products were tape heads for cinema. Hence the name “Cinema Magnetics” which was concatenated to CineMag. Its mission is to manufacture the very best audio magnetic components in the world. However, its history goes back to the 1940's with Ed Reichenbach, later to found Reichenbach Engineering.

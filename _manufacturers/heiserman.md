Heiserman started in 2010 when Eric Heiserman took it upon himself to build a CNC machine for the purpose of making capsules. Intent on capturing the classic tones of the most famous mics in the world, Eric managed to reverse engineer several capsule designs. He soon began providing capsules for sale to the DIY community.

This is a recreation of the classic Neumann k87 capsule. It is designed to work with the vintage u87(i) circuit and features electrically isolated backplates. Most people find this to be a smooth and fairly neutral sounding capsule, without the excessive brightness sometimes attributed to modern U87's.

This is a reproduction of the famous k67 capsule by Neumann. Originally released in 1960 in the u67, the k67 was meant to be a replacement for the k47 capsule. It was designed to be more consistent and easy to produce than the k47 and featured separate backplates. This capsule is identical to our HK87 capsule, but without isolated backplates.

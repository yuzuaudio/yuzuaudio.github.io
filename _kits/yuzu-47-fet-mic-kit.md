The Yuzu 47 FET Microphone Kit is our faithful recreation of the classic German large-diaphragm condenser microphone from the 1970s.

Based on a circuit design around a single JFET transistor and an output transformer, this microphone is equipped with a dual-diaphragm capsule with a common backplate in order to achieve its distinctive sound.

Available in different configurations.

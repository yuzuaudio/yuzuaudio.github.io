The Yuzu Class A Preamp and Equalizer kit is our faithful recreation of the classic British Class A preamp from the 1970s.

Based on a circuit design around several input/output transformers, this preamp also offers a three-band equalizer and a high pass filter to provide its rich warm sound.

Available in different configurations.

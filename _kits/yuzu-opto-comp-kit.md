The Yuzu Opto Compressor kit is our faithful recreation of the classic American optical compressor from the 1960s.

Based on a circuit design around several vacuum tubes, transformers and a photocell attenuator, this compressor uses a point-to-point topology to achieve its smooth compression characteristics with slow attack and release times.

Available in different kit configurations and pre-built options.

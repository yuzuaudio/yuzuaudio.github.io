The Yuzu Passive Equalizer kit is our faithful recreation of the classic American passive equalizer from the 1950s.

Based on a circuit design around several vacuum tubes and transformers, this equalizer uses a point-to-point topology with inductors and capacitors to achieve its smooth equalization curves.

Available in different kit configurations and pre-built options.

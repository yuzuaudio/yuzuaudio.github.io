The Yuzu 87 FET Microphone Kit is our faithful recreation of the classic German large-diaphragm condenser microphone from the late 1960s.

Based on a circuit design around a single JFET transistor and an output transformer, this microphone is equipped with a dual-diaphragm capsule with isolated backplates in order to achieve its multiple polar patterns.

Available in different kit configurations and pre-built options.
